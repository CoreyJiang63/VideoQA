# Task: repetitive action counting
## Dataset: RepCount
**Prompt**  

I want you to act as a professional annotator. You need to generate the question-and-answer pair data to train the model based on the provided data. I will give you the image sampled from the video or the image caption or video summary of this video and the original labels. All the information that the answer needs is contained in the label files. Please remember you are a professional annotator and finish your work as required. Do not consider to brefily the generation.

There are some rules you need to obey:  

### 1）For generating questions based on the provided image:

- Basic setting: The generated question should showcase this information: you are provided a video about something and need try to understand what happened this video.

- Question Type: It could be a judgment question, essay question, or any other specified format.
  - If you want to create judgement question. Please ensure the response is No or Yes with the same probability.  Note that the probability of each response, i.e. Yes's and No's, should be equal and balanced, so ensure a balance in question devising.
- Contextual Background: Craft a background story that provides a context to the scene depicted in the image. This might involve describing the setting, the time, the atmosphere, or any relevant details that set the stage.

- Motivation: Explain the motivation or reason behind the question. For instance, begin with an introduction explaining the scenario or situation, then delve into why this particular question is being asked. Further, indicate what one hopes to achieve or understand by getting the answer.

- Activity Description: Describe the activities or events taking place in the video, but avoid direct mentions of the exact action being performed.

- Variety in Storytelling: Ensure a diverse range of background stories. Repeating the same story or context should be avoided.

- Diversity in Format: The generated questions and answers should come in a variety of formats and narratives to cater to different interpretations of the video.


### 2） For generating answer:
Based on the annotation, video and original answer:
- First of all, you need to generate the standard original answer based on the annotations of this video for the original question.
- Following the generated question by you, you need to write many details. Examine the provided image carefully based on the supplied photograph or image caption. Describe the scene in great detail, focusing on the primary action. 
- Additionally, elaborate on the potential context or background story that could explain the circumstances leading up to this moment.
     
### 3） the generated results:
- Ensure Variety: While maintaining continuity, make sure each pair is unique and captures different aspects of the source materials.
- Maintain Clarity: Despite the number of pairs, each question and answer should be clear, concise, and relevant to the source materials.
- Reliability： Do not ask any question that cannot be answered confidently.
- Accuracy: Do not omit the key information when generating the answer.

### 4） the output format:
- First of all， please use JSON format to reply to me.
- Please follow this format to give the final result. For one video and its annotation, generate 10 continuous question-answer pairs based on the video annotations, images, and associated captions or video summaries. Do not include any interjected notes, disclaimers, or extraneous information. Simply produce the pairs consecutively. Do not pause, add notes, disclaimers, or any other commentary. 

    ```json
    {
        "video name":{
            "1":{
            "Original question": "This is the question provided by me or generated by you",
            "Original answer": "This is the answer you created based on the annotation and the original question",
            "The question with details": "Your generated question, elaborated in depth, which should adhere to the requirements and incorporate more narrative or motivation elements",
            "The answer with details": "Your answer, expanded and detailed, elaborated in depth, which should offer a comprehensive understanding by explaining the context, reasons, scene knowledge, action motivations, or other pertinent information.",
            },
            "2":{},
            ...
            "5":{},
       },
        "video name 2": {},
        ...
    }
    ```



### 5) Special requirements for this task.
- You only could use video name which extracted from annotation to generation the output JSON file. This information should not appear in any question or answer.
- I will give you two videos' annotations, you should provide 5 uninterrupted Q&A pairs for one video and its annotation.
- Hence, you should generate 10 Q&A pairs for once input.
- original annotation tabel format:

    | Action | Video Name | Repetition Count | Start Frame1 | End Frame1 | ... | Start FrameN | End FrameN |
    |--------|------------|------------------|--------------|------------|-----|--------------|------------|
    |        |            |                  |              |            | ... |              |            |

    - The columns "Start FrameN" and "End FrameN" will appear based on the number of repetitions.
    - The ellipsis (...) indicates that the table can extend to as many repetitions as needed.

- Question 2.1 : 
    - Objective: Create questions and answers based on you've provided the action sequences annatations, images, image's captions, or video summaries extracted from the original video. Questions should accurately reflect the depicted actions or described events. 
        - Subject Selection: 
            - The subject of the question can be any reasonable role that fits the context of the video. Examples include but are not limited to: "instructor", "student", "boy".
            - Feel free to change or vary the subject across different question-and-answer pairs.
        - Action Selection: 
            - You could craft one or more anomaly case or repetitive action class from the provided annotations. After choose the case, make sure to provide clarity by adding slight variations or contexts.
            - You also could choose or create related anomaly case or repetitive action class based on your knowledge, scene information, or others. But you need to ensure the generated action phrase is reasonable.
        - Temporal Relationship: 
            - Integrate temporal relationships among the chosen actions in the question, such as "before", "after", "while", "until", "and then", etc.
            - Ensure clarity in the sequence, especially when the number of actions exceeds two
        - Flexibility: Your questions should highlight the repetitive nature of the single action class in the video. While formulating questions, ensure they capture the essence and frequency of the depicted action. Here are some suggested formats:
            - Counting Repetitions: Emphasize the number of times the action occurred.
                - Example: "Did the [chosen subject] perform [action A] more than [n times] in the video?" 
            - Intervals Between Actions: If there are noticeable pauses or intervals between repetitions, highlight this.
                - Example: "After every [action A], did the [chosen subject] pause briefly before repeating?"
            - Starting and Ending: Draw attention to the beginning or conclusion of the repetitive action.
                - Example: "Did the video begin with the [chosen subject] immediately performing [action A]?"
                - Example: "By the end of the video, was the [chosen subject] still continuously doing [action A]?"
        - Answer:

        - The number of Q&A pairs: 
            - Based on you given two videos' annotations, you should provide 5 uninterrupted Q&A pairs for one video and its annotation. Hence, you should generate 10 Q&A pairs for once input.
        - The output format：  
            - Note using the given JSON template to return the generation result.
  - Original question and answer:
      - Original question: your designed judgment question.
