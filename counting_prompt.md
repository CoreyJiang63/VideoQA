# Task: Sequence video verification
## Dataset: CSV
**Prompt**  

I want you to act as a professional annotator. You need to generate the question-and-answer pair data to train the model based on the provided data. I will give you the image sampled from the video or the image caption or video summary of this video and the original labels. All the information that the answer needs is contained in the label files. Please remember you are a professional annotator and finish your work as required. Do not consider to brefily the generation.

There are some rules you need to obey:  
1） For generating questions based on the provided video:
    - Question Type: It could be a judgment question, essay question, or any other specified format.

    - Contextual Background: Craft a background story that provides a context to the scene depicted in the image. This might involve describing the setting, the time, the atmosphere, or any relevant details that set the stage.

    - Motivation: Explain the motivation or reason behind the question. For instance, begin with an introduction explaining the scenario or situation, then delve into why this particular question is being asked. Further, indicate what one hopes to achieve or understand by getting the answer.

    - Activity Description: Describe the activities or events taking place in the video, but avoid direct mentions of the exact action being performed.

    - Variety in Storytelling: Ensure a diverse range of background stories. Repeating the same story or context should be avoided.

    - Diversity in Format: The generated questions and answers should come in a variety of formats and narratives to cater to different interpretations of the video.


2） For generating answer:
    Based on the annotation, video and original answer:
    - First of all, you need to generate the standard original answer based on the annotations of this video for the original question.
    - Following the generated question by you, you need to write many details. Examine the provided image carefully based on the supplied photograph or image caption. Describe the scene in great detail, focusing on the primary action. 
    - Additionally, elaborate on the potential context or background story that could explain the circumstances leading up to this moment.
     
3） the generated results:
- Ensure Variety: While maintaining continuity, make sure each pair is unique and captures different aspects of the source materials.
- Maintain Clarity: Despite the number of pairs, each question and answer should be clear, concise, and relevant to the source materials.


4） the output format:

First of all， please use JSON format to reply to me.

Please follow this format to give the final result. Generate 10 continuous question-answer pairs based on the video annotations, images, and associated captions or video summaries. Do not include any interjected notes, disclaimers, or extraneous information. Simply produce the pairs consecutively. Do not pause, add notes, disclaimers, or any other commentary. Just provide 10 uninterrupted Q&A pairs.

```json
{
    "1":{
        "Original question": "This is the question provided by me or generated by you",
        "Original answer": "This is the answer you created based on the annotation and the original question",
        "The question with details": "Your generated question, elaborated in depth, which should adhere to the requirements and incorporate more narrative or motivation elements",
        "The answer with details": "Your answer, expanded and detailed, elaborated in depth, which should offer a comprehensive understanding by explaining the context, reasons, scene knowledge, action motivations, or other pertinent information.",
    },
    "2":{},
    ...
    "5":{},
}


5) original annotation tabel format:

    | Action | Video Name | Repetition Count | Start Frame1 | End Frame1 | ... | Start FrameN | End FrameN |
    |--------|------------|------------------|--------------|------------|-----|--------------|------------|
    |        |            |                  |              |            | ... |              |            |

    - The columns "Start FrameN" and "End FrameN" will appear based on the number of repetitions.
    - The ellipsis (...) indicates that the table can extend to as many repetitions as needed.

6) the example of the input by me and output by you.

- Input(provided by me):
    - Question 1:
        - Objective(optional):
        - Original question and answer:
            How many repetitive action happend in the input video?
            - Original question: what actions happened in the sequence video?
            - Original simple answer: As shown in JSON, it is the annotations of this video, that annotate the frame-level labels for each repetitive action.

- Question 1.2: 
    - Objective and additional requirments: 
        - Generate a question: Create a descriptive question about the progression of the action in the video. Your question should focus on the nature of the action's sequence and whether there are any pauses or seamless transitions between repetitions. Do not reference the video name or action class directly in the question.
        Example: How does the action in the video progress? Are there clear separations between repetitions or do they seem to seamlessly flow into one another?
        - Write an answers based on you've provided the frame level annatations, the original video and some frames extracted from the original video. Please describe the repetitive action in the video as if you have personally watched it. Convey the flow of the action, highlighting the start and end of each repetition and noting any pauses or immediate continuations. For instance, mention how many times the action occurs.
        - Aviod information leak:
            Please make sure there is no annotation information present in the generated question. 
    - Original question: your designed essay question.
    - Original simple answer: As shown in JSON, it is the annotations of this video, that describe the action occure sequence.
