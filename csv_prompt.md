# Task: Sequence video verification
## Dataset: CSV
**Prompt**  

I want you to act as a professional annotator. You need to generate the question-and-answer pair data to train the model based on the provided data. I will give you the image sampled from the video or the image caption or video summary of this video and the original labels. All the information that the answer needs is contained in the label files. Please remember you are a professional annotator and finish your work as required. Do not consider to briefly generate your output.

There are some rules you need to obey:  

### 1）For generating questions based on the provided image:

- Basic setting: The generated question should showcase this information: you are provided a video about something and need try to understand what happened this video.

- Question Type: It could be a judgment question, essay question, or any other specified format.
  - If you want to create judgement question. Please ensure the response is No or Yes with the same probability.  Note that the probability of each response, i.e. Yes's and No's, should be equal and balanced, so ensure a balance in question devising.
- Contextual Background: Craft a background story that provides a context to the scene depicted in the image. This might involve describing the setting, the time, the atmosphere, or any relevant details that set the stage.

- Motivation: Explain the motivation or reason behind the question. For instance, begin with an introduction explaining the scenario or situation, then delve into why this particular question is being asked. Further, indicate what one hopes to achieve or understand by getting the answer.

- Activity Description: Describe the activities or events taking place in the video, but avoid direct mentions of the exact action being performed.

- Variety in Storytelling: Ensure a diverse range of background stories. Repeating the same story or context should be avoided.

- Diversity in Format: The generated questions and answers should come in a variety of formats and narratives to cater to different interpretations of the video.


### 2） For generating answer:
Based on the annotation, video and original answer:
- First of all, you need to generate the standard original answer based on the annotations of this video for the original question.
- Following the generated question by you, you need to write many details. Examine the provided image carefully based on the supplied photograph or image caption. Describe the scene in great detail, focusing on the primary action. 
- Additionally, elaborate on the potential context or background story that could explain the circumstances leading up to this moment.
     
### 3） the generated results:
- Ensure Variety: While maintaining continuity, make sure each pair is unique and captures different aspects of the source materials.
- Maintain Clarity: Despite the number of pairs, each question and answer should be clear, concise, and relevant to the source materials.


### 4） the output format:

- First of all， please use JSON format to reply to me.
- Please follow this format to give the final result. Generate 10 continuous question-answer pairs based on the video annotations, images, and associated captions or video summaries. Do not include any interjected notes, disclaimers, or extraneous information. Simply produce the pairs consecutively. Do not pause, add notes, disclaimers, or any other commentary. Just provide 10 uninterrupted Q&A pairs.

    ```json
    {
        "1":{
            "Original question": "This is the question provided by me or generated by you",
            "Original answer": "This is the answer you created based on the annotation and the original question",
            "The question with details": "Your generated question, elaborated in depth, which should adhere to the requirements and incorporate more narrative or motivation elements",
            "The answer with details": "Your answer, expanded and detailed, elaborated in depth, which should offer a comprehensive understanding by explaining the context, reasons, scene knowledge, action motivations, or other pertinent information.",
        },
        "2":{},
        ...
        "10":{},
    }

    ```

If you understand my requirements, please tell me, and then I will send you a set of data which are the first question, an image or only image caption, the original question, and the original simple answer. When you finish the annotation generation, I will give your new data with new question to do this task again.

- Question 1.4: 
    - Objective: Generate questions and answers from the provided action sequence annotations, images, image captions, or video summaries. Questions should accurately reflect the depicted actions or described events. 
        - new rules：
            - Refrain from using identifiers like "1.2" or "1.3" in your answers. Instead, refer to them as "the first video" or "the second video".
            - Elaborate on every action in each video in as much detail as possible.
        ample Question: How do the actions in the first video sequence differ from those in the second?↳
        - Sample Question: How do the actions in the first video sequence differ from those in the second?
        - Sample Answer:
            - First Video: The subject begins by picking up the test paper, then proceeds to tear it. After tearing, the paper is set down twice consecutively. Following this, a glass rod is picked up, and it's pointed towards an evaporating dish and then at the test paper. Later, the rod is set aside. The subject subsequently picks up a tweezer, clamps it, and finally sets down the test paper and tweezer in succession.
            - Second Video: The subject in this video also starts by picking up and tearing the test paper, setting it down twice afterward. They then pick up a glass rod, but instead of pointing it, they directly move on to clamp a tweezer. The sequence concludes with the test paper and tweezer being set down.
    - Original question: What are the actions in the each sequence video and in what order?
    - Original simple answer: As shown in JSON, they are the annotations of these two video, that describe the action occurring sequence.

- Question 4:
    - Objective: This question aims to facilitate a benchmark test. Using the provided two videos, benchmark data, and evaluation metrics, create questions and answers. Your inquiries should precisely capture the benchmark's essence, displayed actions, and described events.
        - Benchmark: The benchmark consists of numerous video pairs. Each pair encompasses two videos, either showcasing similar actions or identical action sequences. The central challenge is distinguishing between two analogous videos.
        - Evaluation metric:  
            ```latex
            During inference, we apply the method that distinguishes positive pairs from negative pairs to evaluate the quality of learned video representations. Specifically in this paper, we calculate the normalized Euclidean distance between two video representations $v_1$ and $v_2$ in the same video pair:
                \begin{equation}
                    d = dis(v_1,v_2)  \\
                \end{equation}
                \vspace{-10pt}
                \begin{equation}
                    y=\begin{cases}
                    1, d \leq \tau \\
                    0, otherwise \\
                    \end{cases}
                \label{eq:logist}
                \end{equation}
                where $dis(.,.)$ means the $\ell2$-normalization Euclidean distance function. $\tau$ is a threshold to decide whether the sequences are consistent. $y = 1$ means the two sequences of videos are consistent, otherwise inconsistent.
            ```
        - The generated question: you could change the framework of question without changing the benchmark's meaning.
        - The generated answer: Only provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the certainty level that both videos share the same action sequence. For instance, a score of 0.8 indicates an 80% certainty of video sequence alignment. A score of 0.0 signifies complete certainty of their difference.
        
    - Original question: Do these two videos showcase the same action sequence?
    - Original simple answer:  Provide a confidence score without any additional commentary. As shown in JSON, they are the annotations of these two videos, that describe the action occurring sequence.
